## About
MerchantsPlus is a mod that modifys merchants in a way which gives them multiple shops which you can cycle through. Items in each shop are not all unlocked at once and need to be unlocked by progressing through the world. In addition the mod can optionally modify the size, health and dialog of the merchants.

Out of all the mods I have made, this is the mod I spent the most time making. Every town NPC (non-merchants now have shops (e.g. the nurse is a merchant now)) have one or more shops that you can cycle through adding almost every item in the game. Lots of merchants sell you progressively better gear the more you progress in your world (defeating raids / bosses / other events). The "Merchant" merchant will sell you class specific items based on the items you're holding (e.g. if you're holding a bow or have archer armor, the merchant will sell you archer specific items). The merchants even sell you mod specific items from TerrariaOverhaul and Calamity (very wip). And lots more!
