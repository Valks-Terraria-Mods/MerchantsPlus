This mod adds over [c/2bd42b:90] unique shops with almost every item in Terraria spread across all merchants. 

Even the guide, nurse, angler, tax collector and old man are now merchants!

Although not all the items are unlocked at once, you will need to defeat bosses and other types of enemies to progress.

Currently there is no wiki, the best way to learn how everything works is by looking directly at the source linked below.

Want to help contribute? Here are some ways you can contribute:
- Suggesting new shops / items.
- Suggesting price changes / item condition changes for making the mod more balanced.
- Listing items that have no sell value.

[c/ffb2fd:Items]
+ Sell more items based on bosses / enemies defeated.
+ Some items get 'upgraded' as you progress.
+ Sell items based on what you currently have equipped.
+ Items that had no sell values now have unique sell values.

[c/ffb2fd:Dialog]
+ Quests (Quests give you hints on what you need to do to unlock more items) (WIP)
