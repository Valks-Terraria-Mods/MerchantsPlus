Mod updated to 1.4.4

This mod adds over 90 unique shops with almost every item in Terraria spread across all merchants. 

Even the guide, nurse, angler, tax collector and old man are now merchants!

Although not all the items are unlocked at once, you will need to defeat bosses and other types of enemies to progress.

Featuring
+ Merchants sell more items based on bosses and enemies defeated
+ Some merchants items get upgraded as you progress
+ Merchants sell items based on what you currently have equipped
+ Items that use to have no sell value now have unique sell values
+ Quests (Quests give you hints on what you need to do to unlock more items) (WIP)
+ Merchants have a chance to drop items on death (disabled by default)
+ All merchants have 300 health (disabled by default)
+ Merchants have slightly reduced sizes (disabled by default)
+ Merchants shoot different projectiles based on bosses defeated (disabled by default)

FAQ
Q: Is this compatible with other mods?
A: This mod does not touch vanilla shops but rather adds its own additional shops to merchants so it should be fully compatible with other mods
