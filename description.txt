All town NPC merchants are stocked with more items to sell now.

This is a very big mod, it is very incomplete and will take a long time to make.

This mod conflicts with my Clothier Dev Vanity mod so I will unpublish that.

Another note: The mods Craftable Crafting Stations, Craftable Pets, and Craftable Mounts will eventually all be unpublished and combined into one big mod called Craftable Uncraftables

Since this Merchants+ mod is so big, you can see what it does in the source code which can be found here: https://github.com/valkyrienyanko/MerchantsPlus

If you have any suggestions or ideas for this mod, go to the mods homepage.
