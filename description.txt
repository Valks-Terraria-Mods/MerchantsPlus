MerchantsPlus turns every NPC that you can chat with into a merchant with several unique shops that you can cycle through. All the shops combined sell almost all the items in the entire game! Not every item is unlocked at first, you will have to defeat monsters and bosses to progress and unlock better items.

The mod is getting more balanced every update, if you have any suggestions or bug reports or would like to contribute in another way please talk to me over Discord (valk#3277).
