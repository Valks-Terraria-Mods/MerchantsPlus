This mod makes the game easier by adding over 90 unique shops containing NEARLY EVERY ITEM IN TERRARIA spread across all merchants. 

Even the guide, nurse, angler, tax collector and old man now have their own shops!

Although not all the items are unlocked at once, you will need to defeat bosses and other types of enemies to progress.

For example, the merchant sells a copper (or tin) pickaxe at first. If you defeat the slime king then he will sell a iron (or silver) pick when you beat the Eye of Cthulhu. He also sells items based on your currently equipped gear. If you have a bow equipped then he will sell you a bow that progresses as you defeat different bosses. If you are holding a sword then he will sell swords and so on.

Progression is not entirely tied to bosses but also world events and kill count milestones.

Featuring
- Nearly every merchant sells more items based on your current world progression
- Some of the merchants items that are sold get upgraded as you progress
- Some merchants sell items based on what you currently have equipped
- Items that use to have no sell value have unique sell values
- Magic Storage NPC has a shop

Planned
- Remastered Shop UI with support for Quests / Bounties
- More Modded Merchant Shops (e.g. Calamity)
- Adding missing vanilla items / giving items that have no sell value, unique sell values
- Rebalancing the mod (this is on-going)

FAQ
Q: Is this compatible with other mods?
A: This mod does not touch vanilla shops but rather adds its own shops so it should be fully compatible with other mods unless the UI overlaps with another mods UI..
